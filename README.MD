The app was made without any third party libraries, only HTML, css, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Inspiration and other notes
Before making this app, I was a senior IoT Engineer who mostly dealt with back-end code and systems but as I'm moving back to fullstack development, I realized that I needed to brush up on my front-end skills again and, thus, made this app.

There's also an [article](https://medium.com/@kzapra/creating-and-deploying-a-simple-vanilla-javascript-web-application-from-scratch-aea485a40d60) on Medium I wrote that is basically a tutorial on how this app was made.

The article covers everything including:
- Using Git (only the over simplified basics enough to get your code into a repository will be covered. Branching, CI, PRs, commit etiquette, and good practices will be on a different article)
- Creating the html side
- Styling the html with css
- Writing the javascript code to make it interactive
- Implementing certain methodologies and good practices
- Tackling responsive design to make the webapp comfortable to use with different sized screens
- Hosting the webapp on github pages

Feel free to read up on it.
